    answer: "It's the fastest way to develop full-stack React + NodeJS + Prisma apps and it's what gives this template superpowers. Wasp relies on React, NodeJS, and Prisma to define web components and server queries and actions. Wasp's secret sauce is its compiler which takes the client, server code, and config file and outputs the client app, server app and deployment code, supercharging the development experience. Combined with this template, you can build a SaaS app in record time.",
